# vagrant-template

This is a very simple template to get you starting with [Vagrant](http://vagrantup.com), it is configured to setup a single VM that is provision with a shell script: vagrant-setup.sh.

To use this template simply copy the Vagrantfile and vagrant-setup.sh files to where you want to setup Vagrant (the root of your project, or some directory above it). Then edit vagrant-setup.sh to make any desired modifcations. vagrant-setup.sh contains a couple of helpful bash functions and commented out examples that should make it easy enough to get you going.
